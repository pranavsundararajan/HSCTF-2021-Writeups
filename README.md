# HSCTF-2021-Writeups
Here are my writeups for HSCTF 2021! This CTF had challenges in Algorithms, Crypto, Misc, Pwn, RE, and Web. I mainly focused on Misc, although I did dabble in pwn and crypto as well, and I played as part of the BASHing_thru_challenges team. Overall, I had a lot of fun doing these challenges especially because there were some unique ones.
